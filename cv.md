## Front-end Developer
*****************************
### Profile
Junior Frontend Developer (not really yet) with no commercial experience, but with a genuine interest in web development. Several months of self-education in basic HTML, CSS, JS make me more confident in my choice to continue learning deeper these Frontend Developerâ€™s professional competencies. 
There is an old proverb that describes my goals for further learning front-end development:

> "We do hope, that all our initiatives will have their bright future. After all "you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other".
